* JSON Resume

This repo contains the code that generates my CV and resume. Currrently it is kinda hacky (e.g. I replace "LaTeX" with "\LaTeX" with sed because mustache can't render backslashes from the .json file). There are two files you need to modify to customize, the first is ~alexday.json~, this should be filled with your information and should be pretty obvious how to change. The second is ~cv/pubs.bib~, this should be filled with your publications, talks, etc. and the keys should match those in ~alexday.json~. Once these are changed you can run ~make~ and you should get a pdf in the resume and cv directory. There might be some extra steps to generate the bibtex files used in the CV but after they are generated the first time they won't need to be changed until you modify the ~pubs.bib~ file.
